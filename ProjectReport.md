## Challenge #1 Complete

For the first challenge, my solution was to simply reconfigure the Guice
module. Specifically, I changed the binding of QueryEngine to
WikipediaQueryEngine instead of FakeQueryEngine.

## Challenge #2 Incomplete

(Explain your solution to Challenge #2. If it is not complete, change
the subsection title above to "Incomplete" and explain how far you got
and where you got stuck.)

## Challenge #3 Complete

I began this challenge by researching and experimenting with Java's
stream(). I created an empty project and figured out how to concatenate
strings in an ArrayList using stream() and collect(). Then, I discovered
map() through reading Java's API, which was key for calling upon the
formatter. Since collect() takes in an optional parameter for a delimiter,
I used it to add a newline between each of the strings.

## Reflection Question #1: Functional vs OO

(Write one or more paragraphs comparing and contrasting the iterative and functional  
approaches to string concatenation you explored in challenge #3. Which do you
prefer, and why?)

## Reflection Question #2: Polymorphism and Dependency Inversion

(Explain how polymorphism engendered dependency inversion in this little
application. Be clear and precise here, as this is, in part, an assessment of
your correct use of technical terminology.
Consider, for example, where exactly is polymorphism used?
Where exactly is a dependency inverted?)
